# I know what you did last Friday
**(aka you screwed up big time ðŸ‘€)**

Timeline of what I was doing while missing the video call for a technical interview on Friday September the ninth 2022.

This project is a way to use my self-directed anger at something creative. 
It's also kind of my bloodless, yet painful, interpretation of the Yakuza pinky finger cut ritual.

## Tech stack

- [Notion](https://notion.so) as data source
